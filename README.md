## Background
I found myself writing various pieces of code, primarily in Python, for the 
[K2 Data Science Bootcamp](http://www.k2datascience.com/data-science) 
(which I highly recommend), and wanted to make them easy to share with the 
community.

As long as everything is in the right place creating Python packages and 
hosting them on PIP is a piece of cake. 

The bash script **pypackage_generator.sh** will automate the setup process 
for creating a Python package, which uses
[SPHINX](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/#)
for documentation and [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for version control.

#### Thanks for looking around and enjoy the day!
